- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Doobles1. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a technical recruiter with an engineering background of 20+ years. I podcast, speak at events, and am a 'thought leader' in the Talent space.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m playing around with Python, and diving into cybersecurity/InfoSec. It's been a while since I wrote a line of code... it's not entirely like riding a bike  ðŸ˜„

- âš¡ My story: I became a recruiter after 20 years of engineering as I loved building teams. 
I started out in the Navy with electrical engineering, moved to mechanical engineering, followed by the Airforce in communication systems (radio & satellite), InfoSec, and IT. 
I moved out of the defense industry into Renewable energy, Project engineering, Satellite/IT at sea, and then... recruitment.
Since 2018 I have been building SRE, DevOps, Infra, Security, Support, Cloud and AI/ML teams for companies like Elastic, GitLab, and Synthesia.
My specialism lies within Security, SRE, and AI/ML. My passion is Security.

I had the honour of helping Elastic and GitLab through their startup to IPO phase, and am currently helping Synthesia with their scaling efforts.
